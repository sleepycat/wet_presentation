## Components

.quote[
  Component-based software engineering (CBSE) is
  an approach to software development that relies on software
  reuse. It emerged from the failure of object-oriented
  development to support effective reuse.

## Components

.quote[
  The main advantages of the Component-Based Development (CBD) approach include effective management of complexity, increased productivity, a greater degree of consistency, and a wider range of usability and extendibility, reduced time to market.

# Implications of .react[![](images/react_logo.svg)] for WET

---
class: left, middle

## WET clashes with the component model

* DOM is managed by React. Don't touch!
* Styles belong in/to components
* Components come and go: global styles hang around
* We want devs thinking in components not attaching classes to divs 
* "include what you use" vs "include everything use some"

# WET|Next?

# Some thoughts

* Design & accessibility, GoC law/policy, implementation and the contraints of the day (IE8!) are tangled together in WET
* Design & accessibility requirements need to be met regardless of the technology du jour
* Building GoC UI shouldn't require me to read WET source and guess
* Design systems are how others are tackling this
* Bringing in new tech needs to be easier
