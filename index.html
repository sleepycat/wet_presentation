.quote[The Government of Canada has an opportunity—and a responsibility—to deliver world-class
services to Canadians. <strong>This will require disruption as we make the switch, both technically
and culturally, to agile digital delivery models.</strong> <strong>To accelerate these 
efforts, I am excited to announce the launch of the Canadian Digital Service (CDS)</strong> to modernize the way the Government of Canada designs and delivers digital services. CDS will be a partner to departments in delivering measurably improved services. <strong>We are rethinking the service design and delivery process</strong> from the user’s perspective, and engaging users every step of the way. -- the Honourable Scott Brison]

.quote[<strong>Iteration should be used to progressively eliminate uncertainty</strong> during 
the development of interactive systems. Iteration implies that descriptions, specifications and prototypes are revised and refined when new information is obtained <strong>in order to minimize the risk</strong> of the system under development failing to meet user requirements. -- ISO 9241-210:2010]
